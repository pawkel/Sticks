# Sticks

Hello, This is my stick game,instructions are below. :)
----


You have two ones at the start, so does your opponent.
You hit your oppenent like ll is left hit left, rr is right hit right ex...
If your hit, lets say a 1 hits a 2, the adds into a 3, but if it adds into a 5, then it is gone.
If somthing like 3 hits a 3, then it adds into 1 because 3+3=6, and then you mod it.
You can also switch and combine like cr, s, cl.Combine right, Switch, Combine left

I hope you enjoy it!
